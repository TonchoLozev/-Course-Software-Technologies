                        <h2>Why Choosing  the Right Storage Infrastructure.</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        I spend a lot of time talking with CIOs around the world, on the infrastructure side of the house as well as the database/enterprise app side of the house.
                        I hear first-hand, from DBAs and IT infrastructure teams alike, about the challenges they face with choosing the right infrastructure for their database and enterprise app environments.
                        I consistently hear stories of the difficulties of meeting service-level agreements, of meeting performance objectives, of providing continuous availability, availability to recover quickly, of driving down TCO and leveraging the benefits of virtualization.
                        Customers tell me they want a virtual, open architecture that will allow them to leverage best-in-class technologies, but are concerned about the performance impact this may have on their production databases and applications.

                        <h2>GETTING A VALUE FROM A METHOD IN JAVA</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        ay that you’re sending a friend to buy groceries. You make requests for groceries in the form of method calls. You issue calls such as
                        goToTheSupermarketAndBuySome(bread);
                        goToTheSupermarketAndBuySome(bananas);<br>
                        The things in parentheses are parameters. Each time you call your goToTheSupermarketAndBuySome method, you put a different value in the method’s parameter list.
                        Now what happens when your friend returns from the supermarket? “Here’s the bread you asked me to buy,” says your friend. As a result of carrying out your wishes, your friend returns something to you. You made a method call, and the method returns information (or better yet, the method returns some food).
                        The thing returned to you is called the method’s return value, and the type of thing returned to you is called the method’s return type.
