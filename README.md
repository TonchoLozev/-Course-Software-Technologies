The **"Software Technologies"** course provides initial knowledge of the most used software technologies in practice and allows students to orientate which technologies they like to study them more thoroughly. Basic concepts from **front-end** and **back-end** development are studied. The course consists of four parts: **HTML5 development** (HTML + CSS + JavaScript + AJAX + REST), **PHP web development** (PHP + MySQL), **C # Web development** (ASP.NET MVC + Entity Framework + SQL Server) **Java web** (Java + Spring MVC + Hibernate + MySQL). The training methodology is extremely practical. The studied material is presented with a **little theory**, with **numerous examples** and a **great number of practical tasks** with increasing difficulty and upgrading one after the other, with detailed instructions. **Practical work** in a class under the supervision of lecturers and assistants (or home for online students) is **over 70%**. The course only introduces the technologies studied and gives very basic skills without going into depth. The goal is not to learn the covered technologies, but to get acquainted with them. In the first few topics, students are introduced to the **HTML5 platform**. Through many hands-on exercises, the basics of the **HTML** web content description language in combination with the **CSS** web content styling language and the **JavaScript** language that builds dynamic client **web applications running in the web browser (front-end development)** are explored. Basics of the **JavaScript** language are studied - its syntax, range of variables, conditional constructs, cycles, arrays, objects, functions and their use, access to the **DOM** page elements. It continues with the practical use of **AJAX** technology for retrieving data from **REST** services and access to **BaaS** Cloud Data Storage (**Kinvey**). To link everything learned in the last few topics, as a practical project, students build a **simple blog system** based on **HTML5**, **AJAX**,  and **REST** service. In the next few topics, students are introduced to **PHP** and **MySQL**. After installing and configuring a workspace for **PHP** (**XAMPP** or **LAMP**), they get to know the language, its syntax, conditional constructions, cycles, arrays, functions. Continuing with very brief introduction to HTTP protocol and processing of GET and POST queries with PHP. Here is a very brief introduction to relational databases and **MySQL** through examples and practical exercises. Learning to define tables and links between them, writing very simple **SQL queries** and accessing **MySQL** from **PHP** - extracting, adding, changing and deleting rows. To link everything learned in the last few topics, as a practical project, students build a **simple blog system** based on **PHP** and **MySQL**. After passing through these topics, students get acquainted with **C # Web development**. It starts with a practical understanding of **MS SQL Server** and the **Entity Framework** technology for data access from **C # applications**. Below are the basics of **ASP.NET MVC** server application development technology - views, controls, models, forms, data access, user registration, and login. Following is the development of a practical project - a **simple blog system** based on **ASP.NET MVC**, **Entity Framework and SQL Server**. In the last few topics, students are introduced to **Java Web development**. It starts with a short introduction to the **Java language** - syntax, variables, conditional constructs, cycles, arrays, lists, classes and objects. Next is the introduction to **Hibernate ORM** and access to **MySQL** database from **Java**. Continued with Java Web Applications (**Servlets** / **JSP**) and **Java MVC Web Development Technology**. Following is the development of a practical project - a **simple blog system** based on **Java**, **Spring MVC**, **Hibernate and MySQL**.
